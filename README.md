# Cyberbullying Detection System

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning and NLP based system that detects cyberbullying from text.  
It helps in identifying harmful comments on social media platforms and can be used for automatic moderation.

The system classifies user input into:
- Bullying
- Non-bullying 

---

## Features
- Detects cyberbullying text in real time  
- Uses NLP preprocessing and ML model  
- Simple user interface for input testing  
- Fast and accurate predictions  
- Can be integrated with social media platforms


##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- NLP (TF-IDF, Text Preprocessing)  
- Flask / Streamlit (Frontend)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pickle for model storage
